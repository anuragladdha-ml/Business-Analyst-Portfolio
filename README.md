# Business Analyst Portfolio

This containts projects done in field of Business Analyst Role

### Part 1: [Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx]
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.

- Project: [Predicting Diamond Prices](https://github.com/arl170330/Business-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Problem-Solving-with-Advanced-Analytics/1.1-Predicting-Diamond-Price.ipynb)
- Project: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/arl170330/Business-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Problem-Solving-with-Advanced-Analytics/1.2-Predicting-Catalog-Demand.ipynb)

### Part 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx]
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

- Project: [Data Cleanup](https://github.com/arl170330/Business-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Creating-an-Analytical-Dataset/2.1-Data-Cleanup.ipynb)
- Project: [Create Report from Database (SQL)](https://github.com/arl170330/Business-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Creating-an-Analytical-Dataset/2.2-Create-Report-from-Database.ipynb)

### Part 3: [Classification Models by Alteryx]
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

- Project: [Predicting Default Risk](https://github.com/arl170330/Business-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Classification-Models/4.1-Predicting-Default-Risk.ipynb)

### Part 4: [A/B Testing]
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

### Part 6: [Segmentation and Clustering]
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
